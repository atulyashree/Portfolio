      I started building software at 17, creating my first project â€” an online jewelry shop with buying and payment functionality. As my interest grew, I began exploring different fields of software development while pursuing my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I started with machine learning and deep learning, then delved into data science, and later explored backend development in Java while interning at a fast-paced, product-based startup. Currently, I am exploring and building websites using JavaScript and its frameworks.
